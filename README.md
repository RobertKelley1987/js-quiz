## Overview

I created this VERY basic quiz SPA to gain more experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user answers 10 questions about the JavaScript coding language, and after submission they can compare their responses with the correct answers. See live demo [here](https://monumental-jalebi-b495b5.netlify.app/).

### What Did I Learn?

The quiz format forced me to use semantic HTML I have never used before, specifically the legend and fieldset elements. I was able to test my quiz's HTML with a screen reader and found it to be a valuable learning experience. I also built on my CSS knowledge by making custom radio buttons using pseudo elements. Finally, I was able to practice writing functions in vanilla JavaScript to fade in elements, calculate the user's score and change page content.  

### Would I Have Done Anything Differently?

I made the mistake of hard-coding my multiple choice questions and answers, which lead to a lot of repetitive HTML and labor-intensive CSS edits. If I work on a similar project in the future, I will definitely strategize better to reduce the repetitive HTML blocks, possibly by making this a React app or by generating the repeating quiz question elements in Javascript.
